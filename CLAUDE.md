# Claude Context for phantom-rs

## Project Overview
Phantom is a powerful CLI tool written in Rust for managing Git worktrees (called "phantoms") with enhanced functionality. This is a Rust port of the original TypeScript implementation, providing memory safety, performance, and a single static binary. For detailed project information, features, and usage, see [](./README.md).

## Development Guidelines
- All files, issues, and pull requests in this repository must be written in English
- Follow existing Rust code conventions and patterns when making changes
- Test all changes before committing
- Always run `make check && make lint && make check-format && cargo test` before committing
- Other rules are written in the [](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Testing

- Use `cargo test` to run all tests
- Use `cargo test test_name` to run a specific test
- Use `cargo test module::tests` to run tests for a specific module
- Do not create and run temporary files for testing. Instead, use the mock-based testing strategy
- To verify that implemented features work correctly, write tests using the CommandExecutor abstraction instead of directly executing commands

## Architecture Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module has one clear responsibility
- **Separation of Concerns**: CLI, business logic, and git operations are separated
- **Testability**: Mock-based testing with CommandExecutor abstraction
- **No Code Duplication**: Common operations are centralized
- **Clear Dependencies**: Dependencies flow from CLI â†’ Core (including Git operations)
- **Performance First**: Zero-cost abstractions, smart pointer usage, iterator optimization
- **Error Handling**: Structured approach with thiserror for libraries, anyhow for CLI

## Important Notes
- Use English for all communications and documentation
- Maintain consistency with existing Rust code style
- Use the mock-based testing strategy for reliable, deterministic tests
- Core modules should not have CLI-specific dependencies
- All external command execution should use the CommandExecutor trait
- Prefer generics over trait objects for zero-cost abstractions
- Run benchmarks when making performance-related changes
- Be sure to read the `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` files for detailed project information and contribution guidelines
