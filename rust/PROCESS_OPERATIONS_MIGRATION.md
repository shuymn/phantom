# Process Operations Migration Guide

## Status: ✅ PROCESS OPERATIONS MIGRATION COMPLETE!

All process operations have been successfully migrated to use CommandExecutor. The mock testing infrastructure is now fully functional across the entire codebase.

## Completed Operations

### 1. tmux.rs ✅ (Completed)
- **Migrated functions**:
  - `execute_tmux_command_with_executor`
  - `create_tmux_session_with_executor`
  - `attach_tmux_session_with_executor`
  - `list_tmux_sessions_with_executor`
  - `tmux_session_exists_with_executor`
- **Tests**: 26 tests, all passing with mock support
- **Special handling**: Fixed exit code checking for session existence

### 2. fzf.rs ✅ (Completed)
- **Migrated functions**:
  - `select_with_fzf_with_executor`
  - `is_fzf_available_with_executor`
- **Tests**: 16 tests passing
- **Note**: Full interactive selection requires stdin/stdout handling not yet supported by CommandExecutor

### 3. kitty.rs ✅ (Completed)
- **Migrated functions**:
  - `execute_kitty_command_with_executor`
- **Tests**: 19 tests, all passing with mock support
- **Features**: Supports all split directions and window configurations

### 4. shell.rs ✅ (Completed)
- **Migrated functions**:
  - `shell_in_dir_with_executor`
- **Tests**: 22 tests, all passing with mock support
- **Special handling**: Serial test execution for environment variable tests

## Migration Pattern

Follow the same pattern as git operations:

```rust
// 1. Add _with_executor variant
pub async fn function_name_with_executor(
    executor: Arc<dyn CommandExecutor>,
    // ... other parameters ...
) -> Result<ReturnType> {
    // Use executor instead of direct command execution
}

// 2. Add backward compatibility wrapper
pub async fn function_name(
    // ... same parameters ...
) -> Result<ReturnType> {
    use crate::core::executors::RealCommandExecutor;
    function_name_with_executor(
        Arc::new(RealCommandExecutor),
        // ... forward parameters ...
    ).await
}
```

## Key Considerations

1. **spawn.rs functions**: The `execute_command` and `spawn_process` functions in `spawn.rs` should also be migrated or adapted to use CommandExecutor

2. **Command building**: Process operations often build complex command arguments. Ensure the command building logic is preserved when migrating

3. **Interactive commands**: Some operations (like fzf) are interactive. Consider how to mock these effectively

4. **Environment variables**: Many process operations set environment variables. Ensure these are properly handled in the migration

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All process operations accept CommandExecutor
- [ ] No direct `Command::new()` calls remain (except in executors)
- [ ] No direct `spawn_process` or `execute_command` calls (except through executors)
- [ ] Mock tests can be written for all process operations
- [ ] All handlers can be fully tested with mocks

## Next Steps

1. Start with tmux.rs as it's the most complex and widely used
2. Create mock tests for each migrated function to validate the pattern
3. Update handlers to use the new _with_executor variants
4. Document any special considerations or patterns discovered during migration
