# Git Operations Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Identified Unnecessary Operations

After reviewing Phantom's actual functionality as a Git worktree manager, we identified that several planned git operations were unnecessary:

**Removed from GitBackend trait:**
- `init` - Phantom works with existing repositories only
- `clone` - Phantom manages worktrees within existing repos, not cloning
- `add` - Phantom doesn't stage files
- `commit` - Phantom doesn't create commits
- `checkout` - Phantom uses worktrees, not branch switching
- `status` - Only worktree-specific status is needed (already implemented separately)
- `execute` - Too generic, specific operations should be used

### 2. Completed Necessary Migrations

**Migrated to CommandExecutor pattern:**
- `is_inside_work_tree` - Used to verify git repository
- `current_commit` - Used for version information display
- `list_branches` - Used for branch selection (though not currently used in handlers)
- `remove_worktree` - Core worktree operation

### 3. Code Cleanup

- Removed unnecessary method implementations from `command_backend.rs`
- Removed corresponding tests for removed methods
- Removed unused `delete_worktree_with_backend` function that relied on removed `execute` method
- Fixed compilation errors

## Current State

The GitBackend trait now contains only the operations that Phantom actually needs:
- Worktree operations: list, add, attach, remove
- Branch operations: exists, create, get current, list all
- Repository info: get root, is inside work tree, current commit
- Worktree info: current worktree

This makes the codebase cleaner, more focused, and easier to maintain.

## Migration Progress

- Total git operations needed: ~20
- Migrated to CommandExecutor: 16 (80%)
- Remaining: Mainly process operations (tmux, kitty, fzf, shell)

The migration is well on track with most git operations now using the CommandExecutor pattern, enabling effective mock testing.
