# Mock Testing Infrastructure - Summary and Lessons Learned

## What We Built

1. **CommandExecutor Trait** - Abstraction for all command execution
2. **RealCommandExecutor** - Production implementation using tokio::process
3. **MockCommandExecutor** - Test implementation with expectation builder pattern
4. **HandlerContext** - Dependency injection for handlers
5. **GitExecutor Adapter** - Adapts CommandExecutor to existing git interface

## What We Learned

### Critical Insight: Partial Migration Doesn't Work

We discovered that mock testing requires **complete migration** of all dependencies:

```
Handler → list_worktrees() → GitExecutor → Real Commands
   ↑                             ↑
   We mock here                  But this still executes!
```

Our mocks are bypassed when handlers call functions that haven't been migrated.

### The Migration Challenge

We identified ~20 git operations that need updating:
- `list_worktrees`, `get_worktree_branch`, `get_worktree_status`
- `attach_worktree`, `delete_worktree`, `branch_exists`
- `get_current_branch`, `get_current_worktree`
- And many more...

Each function needs to be updated to accept CommandExecutor, maintaining backward compatibility.

## Current State

✅ **Infrastructure Ready**
- Mock system works perfectly (see examples/)
- Handlers accept CommandExecutor via context
- Pattern proven with get_git_root and add_worktree

❌ **Migration Incomplete**
- Only 2 of ~20 git operations migrated
- Handler tests blocked by unmigrated dependencies
- Process operations (tmux, kitty, etc.) not started

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Git Operations Migration** (Priority: Critical)
   - Systematic migration of all git operations
   - Each needs executor parameter and backward compatibility wrapper

2. **Then Write Tests** (Priority: High)
   - Only after dependencies are migrated
   - Will enable fast, reliable testing

3. **Update Process Operations** (Priority: Medium)
   - tmux, kitty, fzf, shell operations
   - Similar pattern to git operations

## Key Takeaway

Building the mock infrastructure was the easy part. The hard part is migrating all the existing code to use it. This requires patience and systematic work, but the payoff will be:

- Tests that run in milliseconds
- No environment-dependent failures
- Ability to test error scenarios
- Clear documentation of expected behavior

The investment in complete migration is necessary for the benefits of mock testing.
