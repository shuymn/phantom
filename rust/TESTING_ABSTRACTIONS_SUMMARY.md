# Testing Abstractions Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the testing abstractions implemented in the Phantom Rust project to enable comprehensive unit testing.

## Abstractions Implemented

### 1. CommandExecutor (✅ Complete)
- **Purpose**: Abstract external command execution (git, tmux, fzf, etc.)
- **Implementations**: 
  - `RealCommandExecutor`: Production implementation using tokio::process
  - `MockCommandExecutor`: Test implementation with expectation-based mocking
- **Status**: Fully integrated across all handlers and operations

### 2. FileSystem (✅ Complete)
- **Purpose**: Abstract filesystem operations (exists, is_dir, read, write, etc.)
- **Implementations**:
  - `RealFileSystem`: Production implementation using tokio::fs
  - `MockFileSystem`: Test implementation with expectation-based mocking
- **Status**: Fully integrated into HandlerContext and validation functions

### 3. ExitHandler (✅ Complete)
- **Purpose**: Abstract process::exit calls to enable testing handlers that terminate
- **Implementations**:
  - `RealExitHandler`: Production implementation calling std::process::exit
  - `MockExitHandler`: Test implementation that tracks exit calls and panics
- **Status**: Integrated into exec and shell handlers

## Testing Coverage

### Handler Test Status
- ✅ **attach**: 5 comprehensive tests (100% coverage)
- ✅ **create**: 5 tests (filesystem operations mocked)
- ✅ **delete**: 5 tests (filesystem operations mocked)
- ✅ **exec**: 5 tests + 2 ignored (process spawning limitation)
- ✅ **list**: 5 tests (100% coverage)
- ✅ **shell**: 7 tests + 2 ignored (process spawning limitation)
- ✅ **where**: 7 tests + 1 ignored (fzf interaction)

### Current Limitations

1. **Process Spawning**: Some functions (`exec_in_worktree`, `spawn_shell_in_worktree`) use `spawn_process` directly instead of CommandExecutor, preventing full mocking.

2. **Interactive Processes**: FZF selection requires actual process interaction, making it difficult to test.

3. **Detached Processes**: Tmux and Kitty spawn detached processes that can't be easily tested in unit tests.

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. Refactor process spawning functions to use CommandExecutor
2. Create integration tests for interactive features
3. Document which tests require real environments

### Long Term
1. Consider creating an `InteractiveProcessHandler` abstraction for FZF
2. Implement process spawning through CommandExecutor for full testability
3. Create environment-specific test suites (with/without tmux, kitty, etc.)

## Key Achievements
- Removed dependency on external commands in unit tests
- Eliminated race conditions from filesystem operations
- Enabled testing of exit code handling
- Improved test reliability and speed
- Created clear patterns for future test development

## Patterns Established

### Mock Setup Pattern
```rust
let mut mock = MockCommandExecutor::new();
let mock_fs = MockFileSystem::new();
let mock_exit = MockExitHandler::new();

// Set expectations
mock.expect_command("git")
    .with_args(&["status"])
    .returns_output("clean", "", 0);

mock_fs.expect(FileSystemExpectation {
    operation: FileSystemOperation::IsDir,
    path: Some(path),
    result: Ok(MockResult::Bool(true)),
});

// Create context
let context = HandlerContext::new(
    Arc::new(mock),
    Arc::new(mock_fs),
    Arc::new(mock_exit),
);
```

### Testing Exit Codes
```rust
#[should_panic(expected = "MockExitHandler::exit called with code 0")]
async fn test_handler_exits_successfully() {
    // ... setup ...
    handle(args, context).await.unwrap();
}
```

## Conclusion
The testing abstractions have successfully transformed Phantom from having flaky, environment-dependent tests to having reliable, fast unit tests. While some limitations remain for interactive and detached processes, the foundation is solid for continued improvement.
