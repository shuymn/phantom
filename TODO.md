# Phantom Rust Migration TODO

Active tasks for the Phantom Rust implementation.

- Completed tasks: [ARCHIVE.md](./ARCHIVE.md)

## 📚 Key Documentation

Essential guides for understanding the codebase:

- **Testing Guide**: [testing-guide.md](./rust/docs/testing-guide.md) - Comprehensive testing strategy and patterns
- **CommandExecutor Guide**: [command-executor-guide.md](./rust/docs/command-executor-guide.md) - Migration patterns and examples
- **Test Strategy**: [test-strategy.md](./rust/docs/test-strategy.md) - High-level testing philosophy
- **Test Rationale**: [test-rationale.md](./rust/docs/test-rationale.md) - Why we test this way
- **Architecture**: [architecture.md](./rust/docs/architecture.md) - System design and structure
- **Troubleshooting**: [troubleshooting.md](./rust/docs/troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions

## 📋 Future Enhancements

### 🔴 High Priority

#### Native Git Support
- [ ] Integrate libgit2 for native git operations
- [ ] Remove dependency on git CLI commands
- [ ] Improve performance for git operations
- [ ] Better error handling and recovery

#### Performance Improvements  
- [ ] Implement parallel worktree operations
- [ ] Add concurrent file copying with progress
- [ ] Optimize worktree listing for large repositories
- [ ] Reduce startup time with lazy loading

### 🟡 Medium Priority

#### Plugin System
- [ ] Design plugin API for extensibility
- [ ] Support lifecycle hooks (pre/post create, delete, switch)
- [ ] Enable custom commands and integrations
- [ ] Allow UI/UX customization plugins

#### Configuration Profiles
- [ ] Support multiple configuration profiles
- [ ] Per-project configuration overrides  
- [ ] Team-shared configuration templates
- [ ] Environment-specific settings

## ✅ Success Criteria Achieved

- [x] Feature parity with TypeScript version
- [x] Binary size < 5MB (4.5MB achieved)
- [x] Zero runtime dependencies
- [x] Single binary distribution
- [x] Clean test architecture with comprehensive mocking

## 📊 Current Status

**Rust migration is complete!** The codebase has:
- 519 tests total (0 ignored)
- Comprehensive mock-based testing infrastructure
- Full documentation of patterns and practices
- All handlers and operations properly abstracted

**Known Issue**: One flaky test in `get_current_worktree` that occasionally fails in CI. See [test-race-condition-fix.md](./rust/docs/test-race-condition-fix.md) for details on race condition handling.
