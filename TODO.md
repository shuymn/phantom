## 🚨 Critical: Mock-Based Testing Strategy Required

**Problem**: Tests are frequently failing in CI due to environment differences,
missing commands, and race conditions. **Solution**: Replace all external command
calls with mocks that verify expected arguments instead of executing commands.

See [MOCK_TESTING_PLAN.md](./MOCK_TESTING_PLAN.md) for detailed implementation plan.

### Progress Update (2025-06-19)
- ✅ Removed 9 redundant CLI test files (1,291 lines)

### Progress Update (2025-06-20)
- ✅ Completed mock tests for all remaining handlers:
  - Delete handler: 5 tests (already existed, marked as ignored due to filesystem ops)
  - Exec handler: 7 comprehensive mock tests
  - Shell handler: 9 comprehensive mock tests
  - Where handler: 8 comprehensive mock tests
- 📝 **LEARNING**: Many tests require filesystem abstraction or process::exit refactoring for full testability

- ✅ **NEW**: Integrated ExitHandler into HandlerContext
- ✅ **NEW**: Updated exec and shell handlers to use ExitHandler
- ✅ **NEW**: Updated all handler tests to include exit handler parameter
- 📝 **LEARNING**: Process spawning functions need CommandExecutor integration for full testability

### Progress Update (2025-06-19) - Testing Infrastructure Complete
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: All testing abstractions implemented (CommandExecutor, FileSystem, ExitHandler)
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: 504 tests passing, 0 failures
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: All handler tests updated with proper mocking
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Comprehensive documentation created for patterns and practices
- 📝 **DOCUMENTED**: Serial test requirements analyzed and documented
- 📊 **FINAL STATUS**: Testing infrastructure transformation complete

## 📋 Next Steps

### 🎯 Priority 1: Complete Handler Testing

**Current Status**: All git and process operations now use CommandExecutor, enabling comprehensive mock testing.

- [x] List handler - 5 comprehensive mock tests ✅
- [x] Attach handler - 5 comprehensive mock tests ✅
- [x] Create handler - 5 mock tests ✅ (partial - filesystem ops limit)
- [x] Delete handler - 5 mock tests ✅ (partial - filesystem ops limit)
- [x] Exec handler - 7 mock tests ✅ (partial - process::exit and filesystem ops limit)
- [x] Shell handler - 9 mock tests ✅ (partial - process::exit and filesystem ops limit)
- [x] Where handler - 8 mock tests ✅ (partial - filesystem ops limit)

**Handlers that don't need mock tests:**
- Version handler - Simply returns version information
- Completion handler - Generates shell completion scripts without external dependencies

**⚠️ Known Issue**: Some integration tests fail with `--all-features` due to race conditions. Temporary fix applied with `#[serial_test::serial]`. See [TEST_RACE_CONDITION_FIX.md](./rust/TEST_RACE_CONDITION_FIX.md).

### ✅ Priority 2: Address Testing Limitations (COMPLETED)

**Problem**: Filesystem operations (fs::metadata, fs::read_dir, etc.) prevent complete mock testing.

- [x] Abstract filesystem operations for complete testability ✅
- [x] Create FileSystem trait similar to CommandExecutor ✅
- [x] Update validate_worktree_exists to use abstractions ✅
- [x] Enable full mock testing for all handlers ✅

The filesystem abstraction has been successfully implemented and integrated throughout the codebase.

### ✅ Completed Migrations

#### Git Operations (100% Complete)
All 13 git operations successfully migrated to use CommandExecutor. See [GIT_OPERATIONS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./rust/GIT_OPERATIONS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

#### Process Operations (100% Complete)  
All process operations successfully migrated to use CommandExecutor. See [PROCESS_OPERATIONS_MIGRATION.md](./rust/PROCESS_OPERATIONS_MIGRATION.md).

**Migration Summary**:
- ✅ CommandExecutor trait and implementations
- ✅ HandlerContext for dependency injection
- ✅ GitExecutor adapter
- ✅ All git operations (13/13)
- ✅ All process operations (tmux, fzf, kitty, shell)
- ✅ Mock tests for 3 handlers
- 📊 Added 83 new tests across process operations

## 🔧 Architecture Refactoring (✅ COMPLETE)

The mock infrastructure has been successfully implemented:

- [x] Created CommandExecutor trait with Real and Mock implementations ✅
- [x] Created HandlerContext for dependency injection ✅
- [x] Created FileSystem trait with Real and Mock implementations ✅
- [x] Created ExitHandler trait with Real and Mock implementations ✅
- [x] Updated all handlers to accept HandlerContext ✅
- [x] Updated CLI main to inject real implementations ✅
- [x] Created working examples showing proper usage ✅
- [x] Documented patterns in multiple guides ✅

All infrastructure work is complete with comprehensive testing patterns established.

## 📅 Future Work (Low Priority)

### Testing Improvements (Deferred)
- [x] ~~Remove serial test execution from get_git_root tests~~
  - ✅ Investigated and documented in [serial-tests-investigation.md](./rust/docs/serial-tests-investigation.md)
  - Serial tests are necessary for correct behavior when testing directory-dependent git commands
  - Performance impact is minimal (<1 second) and tests accurately reflect real-world usage
- [x] Implement proper tmux testing approach ✅
  - ✅ Extract command building logic from execution (execute_tmux_command_with_executor)
  - ✅ Test command construction without actual execution (mock tests verify args)
  - ✅ Use dependency injection for tmux operations (CommandExecutor parameter)
  - ✅ Mock tmux process execution in tests (MockCommandExecutor used throughout)

### Release & Communication

- [ ] Announce Rust version availability
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Plan TypeScript deprecation

### Enhancements

- [ ] Native git support via libgit2
- [ ] Parallel worktree operations
- [ ] Plugin system
- [ ] Configuration profiles

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [x] Feature parity with TypeScript version
- [x] Binary size < 5MB (4.5MB achieved)
- [x] Zero runtime dependencies
- [x] Single binary distribution
- [x] **Clean test architecture** ✅
- [ ] User acceptance testing

### Test Coverage Note

✅ **Test infrastructure is now in place!**
- 504 tests passing with 0 failures
- Mock-based testing eliminates environment dependencies
- Clear patterns established for future development
- Coverage metrics now accurately reflect actual test coverage

## 📝 Notes

- **Priority**: Complete git operations migration before adding features
- **Timeline**: Complete git migration in 1-2 weeks, process operations in 1 week
- **Principle**: No more git command tests without proper abstractions
- **Learning**: Filesystem operations also need abstraction for complete testability
