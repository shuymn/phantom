# Phantom Rust Migration TODO

Active tasks for the Phantom Rust implementation.

- Completed tasks: [ARCHIVE.md](./ARCHIVE.md)
- Test strategy details: [TEST_STRATEGY.md](./TEST_STRATEGY.md)

## ðŸ“š Migration Documentation Reference

Key documentation for understanding the codebase:

- **Testing Strategy**: [MOCK_TESTING_PLAN.md](./MOCK_TESTING_PLAN.md)
- **Implementation Guide**: [MOCK_TESTING_MIGRATION.md](./rust/MOCK_TESTING_MIGRATION.md) 
- **Lessons Learned**: [MOCK_TESTING_SUMMARY.md](./rust/MOCK_TESTING_SUMMARY.md)
- **Git Operations**: [GIT_OPERATIONS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./rust/GIT_OPERATIONS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- **Process Operations**: [PROCESS_OPERATIONS_MIGRATION.md](./rust/PROCESS_OPERATIONS_MIGRATION.md)

## ðŸ“‹ Future Enhancements

These are potential improvements that could be added to phantom in the future:

### Native Git Support
- [ ] Integrate libgit2 for native git operations
- [ ] Remove dependency on git CLI commands
- [ ] Improve performance for git operations

### Performance Improvements  
- [ ] Implement parallel worktree operations
- [ ] Add concurrent file copying with progress
- [ ] Optimize worktree listing for large repositories

### Plugin System
- [ ] Design plugin API for extensibility
- [ ] Support lifecycle hooks (pre/post create, delete, switch)
- [ ] Enable custom commands and integrations
- [ ] Allow UI/UX customization plugins

### Configuration Profiles
- [ ] Support multiple configuration profiles
- [ ] Per-project configuration overrides  
- [ ] Team-shared configuration templates
- [ ] Environment-specific settings

## âœ… Success Criteria Achieved

- [x] Feature parity with TypeScript version
- [x] Binary size < 5MB (4.5MB achieved)
- [x] Zero runtime dependencies
- [x] Single binary distribution
- [x] Clean test architecture with comprehensive mocking

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

**Rust migration is complete!** The codebase has:
- 519 tests total (0 ignored)
- Comprehensive mock-based testing infrastructure
- Full documentation of patterns and practices
- All handlers and operations properly abstracted

**Known Issue**: One flaky test in `get_current_worktree` that occasionally fails in CI. See [TEST_RACE_CONDITION_FIX.md](./rust/TEST_RACE_CONDITION_FIX.md) for details on race condition handling.
