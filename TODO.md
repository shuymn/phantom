# Phantom Rust Migration TODO

Active tasks for the Phantom Rust implementation.

- Completed tasks: [ARCHIVE.md](./ARCHIVE.md)

## ðŸ“š Key Documentation

Essential guides for understanding the codebase:

- **Testing Guide**: [testing-guide.md](./rust/docs/testing-guide.md) - Comprehensive testing strategy and patterns
- **CommandExecutor Guide**: [command-executor-guide.md](./rust/docs/command-executor-guide.md) - Migration patterns and examples
- **Test Strategy**: [test-strategy.md](./rust/docs/test-strategy.md) - High-level testing philosophy
- **Test Rationale**: [test-rationale.md](./rust/docs/test-rationale.md) - Why we test this way
- **Architecture**: [architecture.md](./rust/docs/architecture.md) - System design and structure
- **Troubleshooting**: [troubleshooting.md](./rust/docs/troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions
- **Advanced Features Guide**: [rust-advanced-features-guide.md](./rust/docs/rust-advanced-features-guide.md) - Advanced Rust patterns and techniques

## ðŸ“‹ Future Enhancements

### Known Issues

- **Flaky Test**: One flaky test in `get_current_worktree` that occasionally fails in CI. See [test-race-condition-fix.md](./rust/docs/test-race-condition-fix.md) for details on race condition handling.

### Potential Future Features

These are ideas for future enhancements that are not currently planned but could be considered:

- **Workspace Management**: Support for cargo workspaces and multi-crate projects
- **Git Hooks Integration**: Automatic setup of git hooks for worktrees
- **Worktree Templates**: Predefined configurations for common worktree patterns
- **Remote Worktree Support**: Ability to work with worktrees on remote machines
- **GUI/TUI Interface**: Graphical or terminal UI for worktree management
- **Plugin System**: Extensibility through plugins for custom workflows
- **Worktree Sync**: Keep multiple worktrees in sync with specific rules
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in profiling and performance tracking

## âœ… Success Criteria Achieved

- [x] Feature parity with TypeScript version
- [x] Binary size < 5MB (4.5MB achieved)
- [x] Zero runtime dependencies
- [x] Single binary distribution
- [x] Clean test architecture with comprehensive mocking

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

**Rust migration is complete!** The codebase has:
- 545+ tests total (0 ignored)
- Comprehensive mock-based testing infrastructure
- Full documentation of patterns and practices
- All handlers and operations properly abstracted
- **Advanced Rust patterns implemented:**
  - Zero-cost abstractions with generics (no dynamic dispatch)
  - Zero-copy operations with `Cow<'static, str>`
  - Type-state pattern for compile-time safety (Worktree states & WorktreeBuilder)
  - Rich error context with extension traits
  - Builder pattern with phantom types (compile-time validation)
  - Sealed traits for API stability (all core traits)
  - Extension traits for ergonomic APIs (removed - not used)
  - SmallVec optimization for command arguments
  - Const functions for compile-time validation (git refs, paths, hashes)
  - Concurrent async operations (3-5x speedup)
  - Advanced const utilities for git and core operations

## ðŸŽ¯ Migration Complete

The Rust implementation of Phantom is now feature-complete and production-ready. All quality improvements have been implemented, tested, and documented. The codebase is maintainable, performant, and follows Rust best practices.
