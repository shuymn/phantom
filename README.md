## ✨ Overview

Phantom is a CLI tool that dramatically simplifies Git worktree management. It's optimized for modern development workflows where you need to work on multiple features, bug fixes, and PR reviews in parallel.

### Key Features

- 🚀 **Simplified Worktree Management** - Create and manage Git worktrees with intuitive commands
- 🔄 **Seamless Context Switching** - Jump between different features without stashing or committing
- 🤖 **AI-Friendly** - Perfect for running multiple AI coding agents in parallel
- 🎯 **Branch-Worktree Sync** - Automatically creates matching branches for each worktree
- 🐚 **Interactive Shell** - SSH-like experience for worktree navigation
- ⚡ **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- 📦 **Zero Dependencies** - Lightweight and fast with no external dependencies

## 🤔 Why Phantom?

Modern development workflows often require working on multiple features simultaneously. While Git worktree is a powerful feature, it requires specifying paths and branches separately, which can be cumbersome.

### The Manual Process

When using Git worktree directly, you need to specify the worktree path, branch name, and base branch each time. Additionally, switching between tasks requires navigating directories, which can be a bit tedious when frequently switching between multiple parallel tasks.

### The Phantom Solution

```bash
# Traditional approach
git worktree add -b feature ../project-feature origin/main
cd ../project-feature

# With Phantom
phantom create feature --shell
```

Phantom combines worktree and branch creation into a single command, making it easy to switch between and work in different workspaces.

## 🚀 Basic Usage

```bash
# Install Phantom
npm install -g @aku11i/phantom

# Create a new worktree
phantom create feature-awesome

# Attach to an existing branch
phantom attach existing-branch

# Jump into the worktree
phantom shell feature-awesome

# Or execute commands directly
phantom exec feature-awesome npm install
phantom exec feature-awesome npm test

# List all your worktrees
phantom list

# Clean up when done
phantom delete feature-awesome
```

## 📦 Installation

### Using npm (recommended)
```bash
npm install -g @aku11i/phantom
```

### Using pnpm
```bash
pnpm add -g @aku11i/phantom
```

### Using yarn
```bash
yarn global add @aku11i/phantom
```

### Build from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aku11i/phantom.git
cd phantom
pnpm install
pnpm build
npm link
```

## 📖 Documentation

### Commands Overview

#### Worktree Management

```bash
# Create a new worktree with a matching branch
phantom create <name>

# Attach to an existing branch as a worktree
phantom attach <branch-name>

# List all worktrees with their current status
phantom list

# Get the absolute path to a worktree
phantom where <name>

# Delete a worktree and its branch
phantom delete <name>
phantom delete <name> --force  # Force delete with uncommitted changes
phantom delete --current        # Delete the current worktree (when inside one)
phantom delete --current --force # Force delete current worktree
```

#### Working with Worktrees

```bash
# Execute any command in a worktree's context
phantom exec <name> <command> [args...]

# Examples:
phantom exec feature-auth npm install
phantom exec feature-auth npm run test
phantom exec feature-auth git status

# Open an interactive shell session in a worktree
phantom shell <name>
```

### Environment Variables

When opening an interactive shell with `phantom shell`, these environment variables are set:

- `PHANTOM` - Set to "1" for all processes spawned from phantom shell
- `PHANTOM_NAME` - Name of the current worktree
- `PHANTOM_PATH` - Absolute path to the worktree directory

## 💡 Use Cases

Phantom is more than just a worktree wrapper - it's a productivity multiplier. Here are some real-world examples:

### tmux Integration

Combine tmux with Phantom for an incredibly efficient workflow:

```bash
# Open a new tmux window and create a worktree in one command
tmux new-window 'phantom create --shell new-feature'
```

This single line:
1. Creates a new Git worktree for `new-feature` ✨
2. Opens a new tmux window 🪟
3. Starts an interactive shell in the new worktree 🚀

When developing multiple features in parallel, you can manage each feature in its own tmux window.

### VS Code Integration

```bash
# Create a worktree and immediately open it in VS Code
phantom create --exec "code ." new-feature
phantom create --exec "cursor ." new-feature # also works with cursor!!

# Attach to existing branch and open in VS Code
phantom attach --exec "code ." feature/existing-branch
```

### Parallel Development Workflow

```bash
# When a bug report comes in during feature development
phantom create hotfix-critical  # Create worktree for the fix
phantom shell hotfix-critical   # Start working immediately

# After fixing, return to your feature
exit  # Exit the hotfix shell
phantom shell feature-awesome  # Continue feature development
```

## 🔄 Phantom vs Git Worktree

| Feature | Git Worktree | Phantom |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Create worktree + branch | `git worktree add -b feature ../project-feature` | `phantom create feature` |
| Attach to existing branch | `git worktree add ../project-feature feature` | `phantom attach feature` |
| List worktrees | `git worktree list` | `phantom list` |
| Navigate to worktree | `cd ../project-feature` | `phantom shell feature` |
| Run command in worktree | `cd ../project-feature && npm test` | `phantom exec feature npm test` |
| Remove worktree | `git worktree remove ../project-feature` | `phantom delete feature` |
| Remove current worktree | `cd .. && git worktree remove project-feature` | `phantom delete --current` |

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/aku11i/phantom.git
cd phantom
pnpm install

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Linting

## 🚀 Release Process

To release a new version of Phantom:

1. **Ensure you're on main branch and up to date**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```

2. **Run all checks**
   ```bash
   pnpm ready
   ```

3. **Bump version**
   ```bash
   # For patch releases (bug fixes)
   npm version patch

   # For minor releases (new features)
   npm version minor

   # For major releases (breaking changes)
   npm version major

   gh release create v<version> \
     --title "Phantom v<version>" \
     --generate-notes \
     --target main

   # Example for v0.1.3:
   gh release create v0.1.3 \
     --title "Phantom v0.1.3" \
     --generate-notes \
     --target main
   ```

7. **Update release notes for clarity**
   - Review the auto-generated release notes
   - Check PR descriptions for important details
   - Update the release notes to be more user-friendly:
     - Group changes by category (Features, Bug Fixes, Improvements)
     - Add usage examples for new features
     - Explain the impact of changes in plain language
     - Highlight security fixes and breaking changes
   
   ```bash
   # Edit the release notes
   gh release edit v<version> --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## 🚀 What's New in v<version>
   
   ### ✨ New Features
   - Feature description with usage example
   
   ### 🐛 Bug Fixes
   - Clear description of what was fixed
   
   ### 🛠️ Improvements
   - Performance, security, or other improvements

   )"
   ```

The build process is automatically handled by the `prepublishOnly` script, which:
- Runs all tests and checks
- Builds the TypeScript source to JavaScript using esbuild
- Creates bundled executables in the `dist/` directory

**Note**: The `dist/` directory is git-ignored and only created during the publish process.
