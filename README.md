## ✨ What is Phantom?

Phantom is a powerful CLI tool that dramatically boosts your development productivity by making Git worktrees simple and intuitive. Run multiple tasks in isolated environments simultaneously and achieve true multitask development. Built for the next generation of parallel development workflows, including AI-powered coding with multiple agents.

### Key Features

- 🚀 **Simple worktree management** - Create and manage Git worktrees with intuitive commands
- 🔄 **True multitasking** - Create separate working directories per branch and run multiple tasks simultaneously
- 🎯 **Execute commands from anywhere** - Run commands in any worktree with `phantom exec <worktree> <command>`
- 🪟 **Terminal multiplexer integration** - Built-in support for tmux and kitty terminal
- 🔍 **Interactive selection with fzf** - Use built-in fzf option for worktree selection
- 🎮 **Shell completion** - Full autocomplete support for Fish, Zsh, and Bash
- ⚡ **Zero runtime dependencies** - Single static binary
- 🦀 **Memory safe** - Written in Rust for reliability and performance

## 🚀 Installation

### From Source (Clone and Build)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuymn/phantom-rs.git
cd phantom-rs
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/phantom /usr/local/bin/
```

### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/shuymn/phantom-rs
```

### Pre-built Binaries

Download pre-built binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/shuymn/phantom-rs/releases) page.

## 🤔 Why Phantom?

Git worktrees are powerful but require manual management of paths and branches. Also, navigating between multiple worktrees is cumbersome. Phantom eliminates these problems:

```bash
# Without Phantom
git worktree add -b feature-awesome ../project-feature-awesome origin/main
cd ../project-feature-awesome

# With Phantom
phantom create feature-awesome --shell
```

### How Phantom Works

When you run `phantom create feature-awesome`, a new Git worktree named `feature-awesome` is created in `.git/phantom/worktrees/`.
All worktrees created with phantom are centrally managed in this location.

```
your-project/    # Git repository
├── .git/
│   └── phantom/
│       └── worktrees/        # Phantom-managed directory
│           ├── feature-awesome/  # branch name = worktree name
│           ├── bugfix-login/     # another worktree
│           └── hotfix-critical/  # yet another worktree
└── ...
```

This convention means you never need to remember worktree paths - just use the branch name for easy worktree operations.

### ✈️ Features for a Comfortable Development Experience

Phantom provides perfect functionality as a command-line tool. Developers feel the trust and comfort of flying first class.

#### Shell Completion

Phantom supports full shell completion for fish and zsh. Use tab key to complete commands and worktree names.

#### Terminal Multiplexer Integration

Phantom supports both tmux and kitty terminal for advanced window management. This allows you to manage multiple work environments simultaneously.

**tmux Integration:**
```bash
# Create and open worktree in new window
phantom create feature-x --tmux
# Create with split panes
phantom create feature-y --tmux-vertical
phantom create feature-z --tmux-horizontal

# Open existing worktrees in tmux
phantom shell feature-x --tmux
phantom shell feature-y --tmux-v
```

**Kitty Integration:**
```bash
# Open in new tab
phantom shell feature-xyz --kitty

# Split vertically
phantom shell feature-xyz --kitty-vertical

# Execute command in horizontal split
phantom exec feature-xyz --kitty-horizontal npm run dev
```

#### Editor Integration

Phantom works seamlessly with editors like VS Code and Cursor. You can specify an editor to open worktrees.

```bash
# Open with VS Code
phantom create feature --exec "code ."

# Or open existing worktree
phantom exec feature code .

# Open with Cursor
phantom create feature --exec "cursor ."
phantom exec feature cursor .
```

#### fzf Integration

Interactive search with fzf allows quick worktree selection.

```bash
# Open shell with fzf selection
phantom shell --fzf

# Delete with fzf selection
phantom delete --fzf
```

## 🔍 Basic Usage

### Create a new worktree

```bash
phantom create feature-awesome

phantom list
```

### Start a new shell in the worktree

```bash
phantom shell feature-awesome

# Start development work

# Exit the shell when done
exit
```

### Run commands in any worktree

```bash
phantom exec feature-awesome {command to run}
# Example: phantom exec feature-awesome npm run build
```

### Clean up when done

```bash
phantom delete feature-awesome
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

phantom-rs is an **unofficial** Rust port created as a personal learning project. 
While it aims to provide similar functionality to the original phantom:

- **No guarantee of feature parity** with the original TypeScript version
- **No promise of identical behavior** for equivalent features
- **Breaking changes may occur** as the project evolves
- **Use at your own risk** in production environments

This project serves as both a functional tool and a Rust learning exercise.
