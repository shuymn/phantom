# TODO.md Review Report

## Review Date: 2025-01-06

## Executive Summary

The review of TODO.md revealed that the Rust implementation is significantly more complete than the TODO tracking indicated. No falsified items were found - the issue was simply outdated progress tracking that has now been corrected.

## Key Findings

### 1. Phase 5 CLI Implementation - Previously Underreported
Most items marked as incomplete were actually fully implemented:
- ✅ All 9 CLI subcommands implemented
- ✅ All async command handlers implemented
- ✅ Shell completions for Fish, Zsh, and Bash implemented
- ✅ Error handling with proper exit codes implemented
- ✅ Help text generation implemented
- ✅ Verbose/quiet flags implemented
- ✅ CLI compatibility with TypeScript version maintained

### 2. Partial Implementations
- ⚠️ JSON output format: Implemented for 3 of 9 commands (create, delete, where)
  - Still needed for: list, attach, exec, shell, version, completion

### 3. Genuinely Incomplete Items
- ❌ Dry-run mode (Phase 5)
- ❌ Phase 6 items (testing verification, distribution, documentation)
- ❌ Post-migration tasks
- ❌ Continuous tasks

## Verification Details

### Phase 1-4: All Accurate
All items marked as complete in Phases 1-4 were verified to be properly implemented.

### Phase 5: Major Updates Required
The following items were incorrectly marked as incomplete but are actually done:
- "Implement all subcommands" - All 9 commands exist and function
- All command handler items - Async handlers, formatting, error handling all work
- Shell completion generation - All three shells have full support
- Verbose/quiet flags - Fully implemented globally
- CLI compatibility - Maintained with TypeScript version

### Phase 6: Correctly Marked as Incomplete
Testing, distribution, and documentation items remain to be done.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Complete JSON output support** for the remaining 6 commands
   - This is the only remaining Phase 5 feature
   - Infrastructure already exists from the 3 implemented commands
   - Should be straightforward to complete

2. **Skip dry-run mode** (low priority)
   - Not present in TypeScript version
   - Can be added as enhancement after migration

### Worker Instructions
The next task for the worker should be:
"Complete JSON output implementation by adding `--json` flag support to list, attach, exec, shell, version, and completion commands. Follow the existing pattern from create/delete/where commands."

## Conclusion

The TODO.md has been updated to accurately reflect the current state. The Rust implementation is more mature than initially documented, with only minor features remaining before Phase 6 can begin.
