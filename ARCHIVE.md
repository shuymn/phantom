### CLI Features

- [x] Add verbose/quiet flags
- [x] ~~Implement dry-run mode~~ (NOT IMPLEMENTED - Not in TypeScript version)
  - [x] Reason: Maintaining TypeScript feature parity for migration
  - [x] Status: Feature not present in TypeScript, skipped for compatibility
- [x] Add JSON output format option

  - [x] ~~exec command~~ (NO JSON - Process replacement incompatible)
    - [x] Reason: Command replaces current process with exit code passthrough
    - [x] Note: TypeScript version also has no JSON output
  - [x] ~~shell command~~ (NO JSON - Interactive shell incompatible)
    - [x] Reason: Opens interactive shell session, replaces process
    - [x] Note: TypeScript version also has no JSON output
  - [x] version command - outputs version info (JSON ADDED)
  - [x] ~~completion command~~ (NO JSON - Shell script sourcing requirement)
    - [x] Reason: Shell requires raw script output for direct sourcing
    - [x] Note: JSON wrapper would break functionality
- [x] Maintain exact CLI compatibility with TypeScript version
