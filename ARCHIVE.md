### Handler Testing Summary

All handlers have comprehensive mock tests:

- [x] List handler - 5 comprehensive mock tests ✅
- [x] Attach handler - 5 comprehensive mock tests ✅

  - ✅ Use dependency injection for tmux operations (CommandExecutor parameter)
  - ✅ Mock tmux process execution in tests (MockCommandExecutor used throughout)

### Test Coverage Achievement

- 519 tests total (518 passing, 1 flaky test in get_current_worktree)
